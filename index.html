          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p class="para-justify">I first started programming whilst at school. The near-by University
            allowed a few pupils from my school access to one of their computers after hours, programming
            Algol. At the time this involved teletype machines and 5 hole computer tape. Fun! My
            programming development continued with the advent of the BBC micro - As I was working in a
            lab at the time, I programmed one to control a chemical reaction. From there I learnt assembler,
            C and C++ on an MT4 Trading platform and also with a Visual Studio compiler. I use Excel and
            Vba extensively to compile trading statistics. Recently, I have been developing my Python
            skills and learning Web Design.</p>

          <h3>Trading</h3>
          <p class="para-justify">My interest in trading really began in the 80's when Maggie Thatcher
            privatised the Nationalised industies eg BP, BT and British Gas where I made a little money.
            Essentially, it was investing, however, I found it difficult to keep checking my investments
            periodically as for much of the time nothing was happening and I lost interest. So in 2002
            when trading became commonplace on-line, I began to learn as much as I could about trading.
            Trading suited my personality better than investing. I can place an order and focus on the
            trade until it is closed and there is no risk of gaps on an overnight trade. One would think
            that as my trading knowledge improved my losses would reduce and profits slowly increase but
            this has not been my experience. I suspect that until all the elements are in place, losses,
            albeit small, will persist.<br>I am really enjoying the challenge especially as trading knowledge
            is not freely available. I have learnt a great deal on my trading journey but I know there
            is no endpoint and continual improvement lies ahead.</p>
